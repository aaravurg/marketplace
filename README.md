# marketplace
This is Aggie marketplace, an app that allows Davis students to buy and sell their items with ease. We require users to sign up and verify their identity to start using the app. We also allow people to create their own listings about the items they want to sell (including a detailed description and image of their item). Buyers who login can view other people's listings and mark their interest in buying a product. Users can go to their profile and view how much balance they have left. A transaction in this app is a two-way process - the buyer can mark their interest in buying the product and the seller can approve of this process.
